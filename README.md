# Astitva Prana Yoga Shala

**"The practice, Breath Sweat and Bliss."**

Astitva Prana is a holistic sanctuary dedicated to mind-body wellness and conscious living. Based in Mysuru, it is led by a yoga instructor with 10+ years of experience. This project provides a single-page static website designed for high performance and easy deployment.

## Philosophy

### Astitva (The Meaning)
The state of being having a purpose of owning one’s existence, a conscious and powerful presence rather than just being or passing through Present Existence.

### Prana (The Force)
Breath, the life-giving force. The harmony between breath and movement can be achieved only by cultivating balance between these two elements.

## Our Vision
> “To awaken inner strength and stillness by integrating the breath, body, and consciousness, leading every practitioner to realize their authentic Astitva.”

## The Four Pillars

1. **Authentic Yoga Asana**: Traditional lineage-based practice adapted for modern bodies and sustainability.
2. **Mindful Breathwork**: Techniques to regulate the nervous system and cultivate vital life force (Prana).
3. **Guided Meditation**: Cultivating mental stillness and overcoming the fluctuations of the mind.
4. **Holistic Living**: Principles that bridge traditional wisdom with modern anatomical understanding.

## Features & Preview
